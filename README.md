# AmazonWilsonScore

A website that takes a max of 3 products on Amazon then uses a complicated formula to prove which product is better based on the Amazon reviews as well as the output from the program.

I made this project because I like bionomial distrubitions and probability, so I wanted to leverage some of my knowledge and put it to work.
